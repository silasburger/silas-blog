During the first two years of the pandemic inefficiency and queuing was a side effect of the lockdown that was difficult for many to avoid. I was able to avoid tasks such as visiting the DMV or renewing a passport. There was less traffic and a general feeling tranquility on city streets. For every fault that the US has, it isn't horribly bureaucratic.Â 

I came to Berlin on December 10th, 2021 when tests were still required for restaurants and bars. I had to get an electronic vaccination certificate, and even found that I was missing one vaccination since the J&J vaccination wasn't considered legitimate. There were free test centers on every block, which was great considering you needed a test for just about anything.

A few weeks ago I spent an hour at the Volkshochschule, the publicly funded adult schools, trying to sign up for a German class that I can take after work. So after waiting all that time they told me that there were no courses available at night. It was a total waste of time.

In Germany they love complicated processes that involve many minor details and rules. Rules, on rules, on rules. For example, taking out the trash is a mission. There is bio, paper, plastic & metal, and a black container which is still a mystery to me. Glass is taken to a different area; three big containers on the sidewalk. Each a different color - white, brown, and green. You need to toss each glass item into the correct container.

One thing that I do like about Germany is visiting the Doctor. Healthcare is actually much less Bureaucratic than it is in the US. Making a phone call to a health insurance company has never been a more pleasurable experience as calling TK, the public health insurance company. It is a non-profit company, like all public health insurers in Germany. They even can take calls in English, which is good for me.

People here complain about public transportation being bad, but in my mind it is still amazing compared to what I saw in California. Owning a car is necessary to travel around California. In Germany it is optional.
