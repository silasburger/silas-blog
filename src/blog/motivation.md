I want to introduce the habit of daily or weekly writing and reflection into my life because I think it will help me become a better writer and allow me to document what is on my mind. I will use this website to do just that. I will keep it public, meaning I will log experiences and thoughts that I wouldn't mind sharing with a stranger. And if I do feel the need to write something personal, I will resort to pen and paper. There will not be limits or parameters to the content that I post here, so it may vary from day to day or week to week.

As an aside, I will be improving the look and feel of the site as I write these daily entries. I only feel it is worth writing CSS if I actually write these posts consistently. I am happy with the simplicity of the site, and intend to keep it like this. I may add comments, but it really depends on what types of material I end up writing.

So without further ado, on a Saturday afternoon, I am writing my first entry. I am planning to buy a new winter jacket today because my current on is spilling down feathers everywhere I go. My plan is to buy a black Patagonia down jacket and then take off the Patagonia logo with a seem ripper. A couple other thing on my mind are buying tickets to for the Berlinale film festival that is happening in Berlin from the 16th to the 26th of February, and planning a skate trip in Rome in late March. Also, I will have a few people visiting me in Berlin over the next month, which is exciting as well. I view these visits as opportunities to be a gracious and organized host, which I am not yet convinced I am.
